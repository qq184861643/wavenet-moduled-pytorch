# wavenet-moduled-pytorch
An easy-reading moduled pytorch-implemented wavenet for self-study.

borrowed tons of code from [https://github.com/vincentherrmann/pytorch-wavenet] and [https://github.com/odie2630463/WaveNet]

the training dataset is very small and from the generated sample.wav we can tell that the model is overfit with the training data.
so basically the model is doing well.
